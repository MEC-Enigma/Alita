We will be following few conventions :-

1. All Plugins/Features are under hawkeye/core/plugins/*

2. All utilities are under hawkeye/core/utils/*


Create a file `.env` in the root folder and enter the following details :

```
bot_token=<bot token ID>
bot_prefix=<Bot prefix>
bot_test_guilds=[<guild id1>, <guild id2> ..... ]
```

If you are using Linux : 
    Run the bot using `python3 -m hawkeye`
